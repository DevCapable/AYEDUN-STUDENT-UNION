                        <p>Ayedun town in Oke - Ero LGA of kwara state, Nigeria came into existence as an autonomous
                            sovereign community in the pre-historic (undated) time around the time
                            other communities (towns and villages) in this part of the world evolved.</p>
                        <p>Like other communities in the Yoruba land, Ayedun was established by a conglomerate of people
                            from different places of
                            the same historical origin. In this case lle-lfe the cradle of the Yoruba race.</p>

                        <p>The first set of people that discovered themselves as founders of Ayedun were
                            two hunter - Oluodo and Oba Oye: Though it is on record that Olu- Eregun was
                            already an ally of Oluodo having met and lived side by side at Oke Elejola
                            prior to their migration to the present site. Thirteen different sets a migrating
                            people (families/clans) either by accident or by providence met at different times
                            in Ayedun and agreed to live together today. It must be mentioned that different
                            reasons caused the migration of people in those days</p>

                                    resulted in the death of his children like prince Ogun.
                                    The aftermath of this calamity was the emergency meeting

                                    the first Oba of Ijero (source AWON OLORI YORUBA ATI ISEDALE WON by E. ALADEMONI
                                    KENYO).

                                    and Osun, which symbolized his name, thus became the Oba. He was on the throne for

                                    only on the condition
                                    that he was given his natural position back. At this period Olokuku has founded

                                    father's properties be divided among them. He was given a beaded crown and left

                            Ojisunmade who abdicated the throne for his elder brother, left ijero and first settled
                            at
                            Aaye in Ekiti State. When the Oore environs,
                            Oore protested strongly and advised Obajisun to leave Aaye as two Obas cannot reign
                            within
                            the same domain. It is important to note that
                            the Oore of Otun - a counterpart of Obajisun then is now a first class Oba in Ekiti
                            State.
                            Obajisun left Aaye and was in search of a place
                            of suzerainty, which he found in the present Ayedun. On his arrival in Ayedun he was
                            urged
                            to stay and settle down with his entourage.
                            His condition of becoming an Oba over the earlier settlers was accepted because he came
                            with
                            the relics and beaded crown of an Oba
                            and he thus became the first Oba of Ayedun. <strong>The stone, on which he sat while he
                                spelt out his condition, when he came, is still
                                at Imojo in Ayedun and it is on this stone that the installation of every Obajisun
                                of
                                Ayedun is performed till date. The name of the
                                stone is <u> UTU-OBA.</u></strong>

                        <p>
                            On becoming the Obajisun of Ayedun, he built his palace at Odo Ofin. The Obajisun, up
                            till
                            today, still celebrates the remembrance of his father's
                            death, called Oloku festival. The relics of the festival is celebrated every three years
                            in
                            Ayedun and ljero. The relics of the festival when emptied
                            into a steam called Omi-Odo Ede (Ogburuhu) in Ayedun will be seen in ljero thus
                            informing
                            them that Obajisun has marked the remembrance of his father's
                            death. So far, Ayedun has produced sixteen Royal Kings including the present Obajisun.
                            The
                            Obajisun title was christened from Ojisunmade the first Oba of
                            Ayedun.

                            AYEDUN</h5>
                        <p>
                            Ayedun Community has three (3) administrative wards called Ogbon(Section) i.e. <strong>
                                Ogbon
                                woye, Ogbon Ikotun and Ogbon Odo-lla.</strong> This arrangement is similar to what
                            is obtained in
                            many other communities around us and is even supported by modern politics and
                            administrative where our Local Government Area has three (3) districts and every State
                            in Nigeria has three (3) Senatorial Districts. These arrangements though leans more on
                            administrative convenience, it definitely emanated from cultural and traditional
                            lineage, resulting from clannish affinity and contiguity arrangements. This issue has
                            earlier been treated into details in a report tagged "Observations of the people of
                            Ogbon Ikotun on the communiqué issued by Ogbon Iwoye representatives on their meeting
                            with HRM Obajisun of Ayedun on 24" April, 2011".
                            The area concerning the issue on Ogbon in the report is reproduced here for clarity. The
                            existence of three (3) Ogbons (Section) as administrative bodies was by our traditions
                            which has made the Ogbons spiritual divisions that is now entrenched in our custom
                        </p>
                        <h6>The following traditions, administrative arrangements and culture of Ayedun people stand
                            as our support on this claim. See as listed below:</h6>
                        <ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha;">
                            <li>In the culture of the entire people of Ayedun, Egungun (Ebora) is a common
                                traditional festival which we all celebrate at the same period. Ajagunmole is the
                                spiritual symbol of Egungun which are offered sacrifices during the festivals. There
                                are three of those Ajagunmole One in each Ogbon of the Community.</li>
                            <li>In the same vein, each of the three (3) wards (Ogbon) has one lkooba/Oba Alaibe i.e.
                                Iranse (Chief of Staff) for each of the ward heads i.e Uko Obajisun coming from
                                Ogbon Ikotun and as senior, Uko Obaoye for lwoye and Uko Alaye for Odo lla ward
                                respectively this is very informing.</li>
                            <li>Also there are three (3) heads of herbalists (Oloriawo) and they are ordained in
                                each Ogbon. This is why we have Oloriawo Ikotun Olori Awo. Iwoye and Oloriawo Odo
                                lla. This is an age long arrangement.</li>
                            <li>. Of equal relevance and an important one for that matter is the head of hunters in
                                town Le. Olu Ode.
                                There are three (3) also with one each in every Ogbon while the overall head amongst
                                the three (3) is rotated round the three (3) Ogbons. This evidence cannot be wished
                                away.
                            </li>
                            <li>There are three (3) Elekorun, one in each Ogbon. Another confirmation for anybody
                                who does not want to disort history to recognize three (3) Ogbons in Ayedun.</li>
                            <li>Elerikans are one in each Ogbon. 3 also.</li>

                                its wheels. Ayedun tradition recognizes this and has three (3) heads of the
                                community drummers Le. Olori Alulu one in each Ogbon</li>
                            <li>There are three (3) Olori Ologuns i.e, head of warriors, again one (1) in each
